That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.</p><p><em>By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why am I the right JavaScript teacher for you?</strong></p><p>My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2016 to over 350,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.</p><p>Recently, I took all my teaching experience to build this new and greatly improved JavaScript course. It's now the best and most in-depth JavaScript course that you will find on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet).</p><p>I know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge, I designed the ideal course curriculum. <strong>It's a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges</strong>, that will take you from zero to an expert and confident JavaScript developer in just a couple of weeks.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So what exactly is covered in the course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns</p></li><li><p>Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more</p></li><li><p>Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020), and more</p></li><li><p>How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.</p></li><li><p>Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.</p></li><li><p>Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. [This is like a small standalone course]</p></li><li><p>Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. [This is like a small standalone course]</p></li><li><p>Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules</p></li></ul><p>Check out the course curriculum for an even more detailed overview of the content :)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This is what's also included in the package:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy for Business students)</p></li><li><p>Videos are also downloadable. Learn wherever you want, even without an internet connection!</p></li><li><p>Professional English captions (not the&nbsp;auto-generated ones)</p></li><li><p>Downloadable starter code and final code for each section</p></li><li><p>Downloadable slides for 40+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)</p></li><li><p>Free support in the course Q&amp;A</p></li><li><p>25+ coding challenges and 25+ assignments to practice your new skills (solutions included)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>This course is for you if...</strong></p><ul><li><p>... you want to gain a true and deep understanding of JavaScript</p></li><li><p>... you have been trying to learn JavaScript but: 1) still don't really understand JavaScript, or 2) still don't feel confident to code real apps</p></li><li><p>... you are interested in using a library/framework like React, Angular, Vue, or Node.js in the future</p></li><li><p>... you already know JavaScript and are looking for an advanced course. This course includes expert topics!</p></li><li><p>... you want to get started with programming: JavaScript is a great first language!</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Does any of these look like you?

This covers everything you need to know to get hired: from absolute zero knowledge to being able to put things on your resume that will allow you to live the life you want.&nbsp;</p><p>Sounds too good to be true? Give me 5 minutes of your time to explain why I built this Web&nbsp;Development course and what is different here than thousands of other courses all over the internet:</p><ol><li><p><strong>I update the course every month to make sure you learn the most up to date skills! </strong>There is no wasted time here. We won’t be using outdated technologies like PHP, Wordpress and JQuery. Although still useful, outdated technologies like the above are low paying and demands for them are decreasing. In this course, you will learn the specific technologies that are the most in demand in the industry right now. These include <strong>tools and technologies used by the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc… It is geared specifically for people that want to learn employable skills in 2021.<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>After finishing this course, you will be able to apply for developer roles, get a promotion, or upgrade your job title as a developer and earn a higher salary. We won't be taking any shortcuts in this course. <strong>You are going to go&nbsp;from absolute zero: where you learn how the internet works. To mastery: where you build an image recognition app using a&nbsp;Machine Learning API (a subset of Artificial Intelligence) and all the other modern technologies that we learn in the course.&nbsp;Most students have commented how the projects in this course have impressed their interviewers and allowed them to get an offer.<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>This course is taught by an instructor who has worked in Silicon Valley, and one of the top tech companies in Toronto. <strong>I have built large scale applications, and have managed teams of developers. I am not an online marketer or a salesman, but a software developer who has worked directly with these technologies.&nbsp; I love programming and believe that there needs to be a course out there that actually teaches valuable real life skills (because most of them are taught by teachers with no work experience).<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>Your time is valuable and you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. You want a course that outlines the best way to become a Web Developer, in simple and well explained terms, so that you fully understand topics instead of watching somebody on your screen and having no clue what is going on.<strong> I have taken the best pieces, tools, and practices that I have found over the years, and condensed everything into this course. 50 hours of videos doesn't mean much if the instructor isn't engaging or focuses on outdated topics.&nbsp;I made sure that everything covered in this course is efficient and focuses on getting you job ready as soon as possible!&nbsp;<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>We&nbsp;have a thriving online chat community so you really feel like you are part of a classroom and not just watching videos by yourself. </strong>You will have a chance to communicate with fellow students, work on group projects together, and contribute to open source projects. Anytime you have a question, you can ask in many locations and get help right away (including from myself).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>The course is designed to <strong>give you employable skills so you can get a job</strong>. Here is what one student recently wrote after taking the course and being hired right away: <br><br><em>"I’m a self taught dev, who has been out of work for ~6 months. I had some family things that came up that prevented me from seeking permanent employment, so for awhile I was Postmates/Uber delivery driver.<br>&nbsp; <br>After taking this course, I immediately got catapulted back to where I was before, but better equipped and with the knowledge to take on the next job. I had just finished the React section when I went to a recent interview, and it really helped me excel. As of today, I am officially re-employed back in the field, and it is all thanks to this course.&nbsp;I had a blast creating the final project, and FINALLY got around to learning SQL statements, and getting to use them in a project. I’m really ecstatic that Andrei went with teaching relational databases over something like MongoDB, which can also be fun, but is less practical for use on the job.&nbsp; &nbsp;So thanks Andrei&nbsp;, I really enjoyed the course and will be making sure to share it with others who find it helpful. I’m also looking forward to the new ES10 content that was recently added, and going through the DB stuff again when I go to build a personal project." - J.C.</em></p></li></ol><p><br></p><p>Think of this course like a Web Developer bootcamp. By the end, you will be comfortable using the below skills and you will be able to put them on your resume:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML/HTML5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS/CSS3</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SemanticUI</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Responsive Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Flexbox</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS&nbsp;Grid</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Bootstrap 5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Javascript (including ES6/ES7/ES8/ES9/ES10/ES2020)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>HTTP/JSON/AJAX</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>React +&nbsp;Redux m+ React Hooks</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Git + Github</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Command Line</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Node.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Express.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>NPM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>RESTful&nbsp;API Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>PostgresSQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authorization</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Scalable Infrastructure</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Production and Deployment</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>You will be taken through online videos and exercises where you will be able to do the following things by the end:<br></p><ul><li><p>Build real complex applications and websites</p></li><li><p>Build an image recognition app so you can add it to your portfolio</p></li><li><p>Go into a job interview confident that you understand the fundamental building blocks of web development and the developer trends in 2021</p></li><li><p>Be able to go off on your own and grow your skills as a developer, having built a solid foundation</p></li><li><p>Learn how frontend, servers, and databases communicate and how they all fit together in the eco system</p></li><li><p>Build your own startup landing page</p></li><li><p>Go off and work remotely by being a freelance developer that can bid on projects</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>This course is the accumulation of all of my years working in the industry, learning, and teaching. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things, that unless you have spent the last few years working with these technologies in a company, you will never fully understand. So this course is the answer to that&nbsp;exact&nbsp;problem for you: How to gain experience when you need experience to get hired? I have gone through thousands of coding books, online tutorials and bootcamps. <strong>Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked and what hasn't, and I have created this course to narrow down the most efficient way to learn with the most relevant information.&nbsp;</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>I am 100% confident that you won't find a course like this out there. We're not going to be building simple todo applications&nbsp;and cat image sliders. We are going to learn actual&nbsp;practical skills that will put you into the workforce. Some unique sections that you won't find anywhere else are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>React.js + Redux:</strong>&nbsp;You will learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook and Instagram use to build fast, scalable applications.&nbsp;This is one of the highest in-demand skill in the industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>A day in the life of a developer:</strong>&nbsp;What will your day to day look like and what tools will you&nbsp;use?&nbsp;I will take you through a sample day at a tech company.</p></li><li><p><strong>How does the internet actually work?&nbsp;What is the history of these technologies?:</strong>&nbsp;You will actually understand the underlying concepts of the internet, and how the technologies we have now, have come to be where they are.</p></li><li><p><strong>How do you&nbsp;actually deploy a real life app so that it is secure, and won't get hacked?:</strong>&nbsp;How does a real life app get out to the public in a safe and secure way?</p></li><li><p><strong>What is Machine Learning and how you can&nbsp;harness its power:</strong>&nbsp;Whether you have heard about it or not, this is something that you will hear more and more in the coming years. Those who understand the high level concepts and can harness its power will have an advantage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>What does your developer environment on your computer look like?:</strong>&nbsp;We will be setting up our computers with all the tools necessary of a developer so you can use the same setup when you go work in the industry.</p></li></ul><p>Why do we teach the above? Because in this day and age, <strong>just knowing HTML CSS&nbsp;and Javascript is not good enough, and you won't be able to grow in your role and command a higher salary. You will learn these things because these are the things you should know in 2021 so that you are miles ahead of the rest.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Make this&nbsp;the year that you took a risk, you learned&nbsp;highly in demand skills, you had new experiences, and you received new opportunities. I hope you join me in this journey. <br><br><strong>This is the proudest work I have ever done in my life and I am confident that you won't find a course better than this. </strong><br><br>See you inside!</p><p>
